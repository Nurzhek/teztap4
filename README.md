Show the cheapest cart price in the closest possible grocery to your geolocation.
Display multiple markers indicating various locations with customized icons.
Show detailed tooltips upon hovering over markers, including name, address, and working hours of the groceries.
Provide a dropdown control allowing users to switch between different cities, automatically updating the map's center accordingly.
Styling has been applied to ensure the map, markers, tooltips, and controls visually stand out and are user-friendly, enhancing the overall user experience. The map is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless viewing experience across various devices.
